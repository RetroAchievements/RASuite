# DEPRECATED

This repo exists for historical reasons and is not used anymore.

In April/2018 this repository was split:

- [RAIntegration](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAIntegration): with `RA_Integration`'s code only.

- [RAEmus](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAEmus), with the source files of the standalone emulators used in RetroAchievements.org.

**Note**: If you are interested in contribute to RetroAchievements project with code on the emulators front, consider working
on [RALibretro](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RALibretro).
