; Template for creating new input sources:
;
; [Name]
; type = keyboard (digital) | joypad (digital) | mouse (analog)
;   Select the type of input device
; enabled = yes | no
;   Set to no in order to tell MEKA to ignore input from this device
; player = 1 | 2
;   Player number
; connection = <number>
;   Joypad only. Select connection to use: 1 = first pad, 2 = second pad..
; emulate_digital
;   Mouse only. Enable support for digital devices (such as SMS joypad),
;   to play games with the mouse. Recommended with shooters mainly.
; digital_falloff (between 0 and 1, default being 0.8)
;   Mouse only, when digital emulation is enabled. Reduce to increase
;   precision, but most games will be harder to play.
