RAmeka v 0.020535 ()

- Integrating with current RA_Integration DLL (0.068)
- Major code refactoring. Old Meka code now knows as little as possible about the RAMeka additions. Most RAMeka additions now in RA_Implementation.cpp
- Added references to GameGear in RA DLL (ConsoleID differs from current Retroarch version)
- Git merge history looks pretty bad. Might need rebasing if anyone really cares enough.

RAmeka v 0.019535 (Stalking purple ghosts)

- Integrating with current RA_Integration DLL (0.067)
- Merging with RASuite Master branch (Very kludgey, git confusing, (gitless) merge)
- Some overlay issues present (bugs maybe related to new memory model/challenge system)
- Who knows what build system horrors await us next.

RAmeka v 0.018535 (Whispered secrets of Allegro)

- Minor fixes to Sound Interface. Volume can now be set in menu.
- Preparing for Merge

RAmeka v 0.017535 (Probably didn't break anything)

- Fixed disabling_RA_overlay. This now works
- Fixed Rich presence code. This now reports correctly (but isn't currently enabled on site at the moment)

RAmeka v 0.016535 (Mea Maxima Culpa)

- Actually packaging a working dll this time
- Code optimisation now in effect on release build.

RAmeka v 0.01535 (Closing off Loopholes)

- Disable/Warnings for Meka memory editor and debuggers when Hardcoremode activated
- added several user configurable options to help speedup RAmeka when overlays are used.
- Speedup win_layer overlway by avoiding creation/deletion of buffers


RAmeka v 0.00535 (Deciding on capitalisation)

Source Notes:

- Repo (sms branch)
  https://github.com/ARoxdale/RASuite/
  
- RA integration hacks by AlanRoxdale and GameDragon. RA code by Scott (http://retroachievements.org/). Meka code by the teams at http://smspower.org/.

- RA version is based on an older commit of the RASuite: https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RASuite/commit/874229bb062e09e74a17fdb5bc08f6e3f1df34f1
  Expect this dll and emulator to be rapidly out of date as the main suite changes.
  Note RAmeka is effecively using an altered RA_Integration.dll, so don't download the retroachivements.org auto-downloaded dll.

- Based on RAmeka v0.8 alpha which has some sound issues (You may need to fiddle with f2,f3,f4) 
  Main meka source repo: https://github.com/ocornut/meka
  VS 2015 meka build: https://github.com/maxim-zhao/meka/    (maxim-zhao is a saint)

  
Notes:
- The RA menu is embedded in the Meka console, which is a dialog box (the first thing that pops up)
  separate from the main Meka Window. Look behind the main window to find it. This is a hack currently, but it works.
  The title of the console window is RAMeka.
  The RA menus and dialogs visible from this menu should match those of existing RA Emulators.
- Meka at present has sound issues. Fiddle with (f2,f3,f4) if you're have problems.
- Meka has an internal debugger similar to but separate from the RA debugger. Meka's debugger does NOT work with RA.
- To use the layered Window overlay instead of allegro, set "overlay_render_method = win_layer" in mekaw.cfg
- To change meka resolution/refresh rate, you will need to edit the relevant lines in mekaw.cfg
- Basic Meka commands:
	
	ESC 	- Enter/exit windowed fullscreen
	F12 	- Pause / Load RA Overlay Menu
	F5/F7 	- Save/Load State
	F6/F8	- Change save state slot
	F10 	- Exit meka
	RA Menu	- Attached to the RAMeka console dialog box.
- To Navigate Directories in meka, clicking ".." takes you up one directory. Directories have ">" next to them in the Load window.
- This is an early build so expect bugs, crashes, glitches and gremlins. Please leave feedback for any issues. HARDCORE runs are undertaken at your own risk.
